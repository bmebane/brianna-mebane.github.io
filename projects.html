										<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I am a visual designer from Connecticut with three years of experience as a student web design consultant while
										pursuing a double major in English and Computer Science at Wesleyan University. In addition to working as a student
										web design consultant, I have also served as a course assistant for a few classes that involved presenting student work
										via web-based platforms like WordPress. <br> <br>

										Beyond the classroom, I have worked at Wesleyan University's Student Resource Center as an office manager in charge of
										reservations and inventory and previously served on the board of the Black Student Union. In my spare time,
										I enjoy reading books, making playlists, creating color palettes, and playing rhythm games! <br> <br>

										(Oh, and I've studied French for 8 years!)
